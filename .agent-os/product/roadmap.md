## Milestones

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Foundation | 3 weeks | Core infrastructure ready |
| Core Services | 4 weeks | All services operational |
| Parsers | 3 weeks | ASN.1 & CSV parsers complete |
| Web Console | 4 weeks | Full UI with auth |
| Integration | 3 weeks | Tested system |
| Deployment | 3 weeks | Production ready |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **ClickHouse Performance**: Early testing with real data volumes
- **Parser Complexity**: Start with simple formats, iterate
- **Multi-instance Sync**: Thorough Redis lock testing

### Operational Risks
- **Data Loss**: Implement comprehensive backup strategy
- **System Downtime**: Design for zero-downtime deployment
- **Security Breach**: Regular security audits

## Success Criteria

- Process 2000+ files daily without errors
- Sub-5 minute processing time per file
- 99.9% system availability
- Zero data loss incidents
- Complete audit trail for compliance
