> Spec: ZTE ASN.1 CDR Parser with Clean Code & TDD
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a ZTE ASN.1 CDR (Call Detail Record) parser plugin for the TIA ETL system following strict Clean Code principles and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies. The parser will process ZTE telecommunications equipment ASN.1 encoded files and load processed data into ClickHouse with a non-nullable, optimized schema design.

This implementation emphasizes code quality, maintainability, and reliability through:
- SOLID design principles
- Comprehensive test coverage with TDD approach
- Non-nullable ClickHouse schema for data integrity
- Efficient storage without raw record retention
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code structure

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want a parser implementation that follows Clean Code principles so that it's maintainable and extensible
- I want comprehensive unit tests written before implementation so that I can confidently refactor and extend the code
- I want clear separation of concerns so that each component has a single responsibility
- I want dependency injection so that components are loosely coupled and testable

### As a System Administrator
- I want a ClickHouse schema with no nullable fields so that data integrity is guaranteed
- I want efficient data storage without raw record bloat so that storage costs are minimized
- I want reliable error handling so that parsing failures don't corrupt the database
- I want comprehensive logging so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively

### As a Data Analyst
- I want structured, validated CDR data in ClickHouse so that I can perform accurate analytics
- I want consistent field formats and types so that queries are predictable
- I want complete field documentation so that I understand what each column contains
- I want data validation guarantees so that I can trust the processed results

### As a QA Engineer
- I want automated tests at multiple levels so that regressions are caught early
- I want integration tests with real ASN.1 samples so that parsing accuracy is verified
- I want performance tests so that processing speed requirements are met
- I want error scenario tests so that edge cases are handled properly

## Spec Scope

### In Scope
1. **Clean Code Implementation**
   - SOLID design principles implementation
   - Clear naming conventions and code organization
   - Proper abstraction layers and interfaces
   - Comprehensive inline documentation

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Unit tests for all business logic (>90% coverage)
   - Integration tests with sample ASN.1 files
   - Performance benchmarks and validation
   - Error scenario testing

3. **ZTE ASN.1 CDR Parsing**
   - Complete ASN.1 BER/DER decoding support
   - ZTE-specific CDR field mapping
   - Data validation and type conversion
   - Error handling for malformed records

4. **ClickHouse Integration**
   - Non-nullable schema design
   - Optimized batch insertion
   - Data type validation before insertion
   - Monthly partitioning support

5. **Plugin Integration**
   - Implementation of DataParser interface
   - Dynamic loading compatibility
   - Configuration parameter support
   - Resource cleanup and lifecycle management

### Out of Scope
1. Raw record storage (Base64 ASN.1 data retention)
2. Nullable field support in ClickHouse schema
3. Real-time streaming processing
4. Historical data migration
5. GUI configuration interface

## Expected Deliverable
