> Spec: File Scanner Service (TDD Implementation)
> Created: 2025-08-28

## Overview

Implement a distributed file scanning service using Test-Driven Development methodology that monitors configured directories for ASN.1 and CSV files from telecom operators, validates them, and queues them for processing. This service will be built test-first to ensure high reliability, maintainability, and complete test coverage for this critical ETL pipeline component.

## User Stories

### Test-Driven File Discovery

As a Developer, I want the file scanner service built using TDD methodology, so that every component has comprehensive test coverage and the service is highly maintainable and reliable.

The development will follow red-green-refactor cycles, starting with failing tests that define expected behavior, implementing minimal code to pass tests, then refactoring for clean code principles. Each component will have unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests before implementation begins.

### Automated Directory Monitoring

As a System Administrator, I want to configure directory scanning jobs that automatically discover new CDR files, so that I don't need to manually check for and queue files for processing.

The service will periodically scan configured directories based on job schedules (cron or fixed intervals), identify files matching specified patterns, validate their format and accessibility, and add them to a Redis queue for processing by the parser-orchestrator service. All functionality will be developed test-first with comprehensive test scenarios.

### Multi-Instance Coordination

As a DevOps Engineer, I want the file scanner to coordinate across multiple instances with test-verified distributed locking, so that we can scale horizontally without duplicate file processing or conflicts.

Multiple scanner instances will use Redis distributed locks to claim files for processing, ensuring each file is processed exactly once. The service will maintain instance health in Redis and automatically redistribute work if an instance fails. All distributed coordination logic will be developed with thorough integration tests.

## Spec Scope

1. **TDD Test Framework Setup** - JUnit 5, MockK, Testcontainers for integration tests, and test fixtures
2. **Directory Scanning Engine** - Test-driven recursive scanning with pattern matching and validation
3. **Redis Queue Management** - Fully tested distributed queue with locks, priorities, and retry logic
4. **Job Configuration CRUD** - Test-first API development with validation and error handling
5. **Multi-Instance Coordination** - Integration-tested distributed locking and failover mechanisms

## Out of Scope

- Actual file parsing (handled by parser-orchestrator)
- File content transformation or modification
- Direct ClickHouse database writes
- User authentication (handled by API Gateway)
- Performance optimization before establishing baseline through tests

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete test suite with >90% code coverage including unit, integration, and contract tests
2. REST API endpoints developed test-first with comprehensive test scenarios
3. Background service with test-verified scheduling, scanning, and queueing functionality
