### 1.2 Structure of the CDR File

#### 1.2.1 Field
Basic data unit, which is the basic element forming the ticket record. Each field has its own tag and length (Len). The field can be divided into fixed length field and non-fixed length field.

#### 1.2.2 Charging Data Record
Record the billing information related to a chargeable event. Each CDR contains multiple fields.

#### 1.2.3 Block
The block contains one or more (n) CDRs with variable lengths (L). The block has a fixed size which can be configured to 2048 or 4096 or 8192 bytes. It is filled with CDRs until there is no more room to add the next record. The rest of the fixed size block will then be filled with fillers(H'FF).

**Figure 1: Structure Diagrams of Block**
```
+-------+-------+-----+-------+---------+

### 1.3 CDR Encoding

#### 1.3.1 ASN.1 (Basic Encoding Rules) description

The CDRs generated at GSN/CGF is specified using the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1). ASN.1 is a language that defines the way data is sent across dissimilar communication systems. ASN.1 ensures that the data received is the same as the data transmitted by providing a common syntax for specifying application layer protocols. ASN.1 is an ISO/ITU-T standard based on the OSI model and is defined in "ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Basic Notation, ITU-T Recommendation X.680".

The GSN/CGF uses ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER) to encode the CDRs. BER is a set of standard rules, defined in "ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Canonical Encoding Rules (CER) and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) ITU-T Recommendation X.690", for encoding data types specified in ASN.1. A field containing a value of a certain data type is encoded into the following parts:
- **Identifier**: identifies the data type and consists of an ASN.1 tag and data structure information
- **Length**: the length of the content part in number of octets
- **Contents**: the value encoded according to data type specific rules

The ASN.1 tags assigned to CDR fields are specified in chapter 3.3.

#### 1.3.2 Encoding of the Tag

The identifier octets encode the ASN.1 tag of the data value. Two possibilities exist:

**A. Single octet encoding for tag numbers from 0 to 30 (inclusive)**

```
Octet 1:  [CLASS | P/C | NUMBER of TAG]
           8 7     6     5 4 3 2 1
```

- **Bits 8-7**: Class identifier
  - 00: Universal
  - 01: Application  
  - 10: Context-specific
  - 11: Private

- **Bit 6**: 
  - 0: Primitive
  - 1: Constructed

- **Bits 5-1**: binary integer with bit 5 as msb

**B. Use of a leading octet for tag numbers bigger than or equal to 31**

The leading octet is encoded as follows:
```
Octet 1:  [CLASS | P/C | 11111]
           8 7     6     5-1

Subsequent octets:
- Bit 8: set to 1 in all non-last subsequent octets
- Bits 7-1: Bits 7-1 of all subsequent octets encoded as a binary integer equal to the tag number
```

#### 1.3.3 Encoding of the length

The length octets encode the length of the following content of the data item. Three possibilities exist in ASN.1: short, long and indefinite. The indefinite variant is not used in this CDR format.

**A. Short length encoding for length from 0 to 127 (inclusive)**
```
Octet 1: [0|LLLLLLL]
          8  7-1
```
LLLLLLL represents the length of the content

**B. Long length encoding for length > 127**
```
Octet 1:   [1|n (where n < 127)]
Octet 2-n+1: Length value
```


#### 1.3.4 Encoding of the content

The numbering of bits within one octet and the encoding of a binary value in an octet structure:
```
Octet 1:  [most significant byte]
Octet 2:  [...]  
Octet n:  [least significant byte]
           8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
- bit 8 of octet 1 is the most significant bit (msb)
- bit 1 of octet n is the least significant bit (lsb)

#### 1.3.5 ASN.1 BER Encoding of Integers

ASN.1 defines the integer type as a simple type with distinguished values, which are the positive and negative numbers, including zero. The content part for a field of type integer is BER encoded in one or more octets. The content octets contain the two's complement binary number equal to the integer value, and consisting of bits 8 to 1 of the first octet, followed by bit 8 to 1 of each octet in turn up to and including the last content octet. 

The two's complement form implies that the most significant bit of the content octets indicates the sign of the value (0 for positive numbers and 1 for negative numbers). This means that the highest positive number a sequence of X octets can represent is: 2^(8X-1)-1.

**Example 1:**
The highest positive number represented by four octets (32 bits) is: 2^31-1.

**Example 2:**
To represent the highest value for a 32 bits positive integer (2^32-1), five content octets are needed.

### 2.4 Description of Fields

This chapter is the brief description of each field of CDR mentioned above.

#### 2.4.1 3GPP2 User Location Information
The field is correspond to the ASN.1 field "threeGPP2UserLocationInformation".
This field contains the User Location Information of the MS (BSID or Subnet), if available.

#### 2.4.2 Access Point Name (APN) Network/Operator Identifier
The field is correspond to the ASN.1 field "accessPointNameNI/ accessPointNameOI".
These fields contain the actual connected Access Point Name (APN) Network/Operator Identifier determined either by MS, SGSN/MME or modified by CAMEL service. An APN can also be a wildcard, in which case the SGSN/MME selects the APN.

APN network identifier includes not just a flag, but also corresponds with the domain name of Internet.
APN operator identifier is composed of three labels. The first and second labels together shall uniquely identify the GPRS PLMN (e.g. "operator name>.<operator group>.gprs").

To represent the APN NI and OI in the PCN CDRs, the "dot" notation shall be used.

See 3GPP TS 23.003 [68] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] for more information about APN format and access point decision rules.

#### 2.4.3 APN Selection Mode
The field is correspond to the ASN.1 field "apnSelectionMode".
This field describes how the APN (selected by the SGSN/MME) to be used. The values and their meaning are as specified in Charter 7.9 'Information Elements' of 3GPP TS 29.060 clause.

#### 2.4.4 CAMEL Information
The field is correspond to the ASN.1 field "cAMELInformationMM/ cAMELInformationPDP/cAMELInformationSMS".
This field includes the following CAMEL information elements for S-CDR, M-CDR and S-SMO-CDR.

**CAMEL Access Point Name NI (S-CDR)**
This field contains the network identifier part of APN before modification by the SCF.

**CAMEL Access Point Name OI (S-CDR)**
This field contains the operator identifier part of APN before modification by the SCF.

**CAMEL Calling Party Number (S-SMO-CDR)**
This field contains the Calling Party Number modified by the CAMEL service.

**CAMEL Destination Subscriber Number (S-SMO-CDR)**
This field contains the short message Destination Number modified by the CAMEL service

**CAMEL SMSC Address (S-SMO-CDR)**
This field contains the SMSC address modified by the CAMEL service.

**SCF address (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR)**
This field identifies the CAMEL server serving the subscriber. Address is defined in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription information.

**Service key (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR)**
This field identifies the CAMEL service logic applied. Service key is defined in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription information.

**Default Transaction/SMS Handling (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR)**
This field indicates whether or not a CAMEL encountered default GPRS- or SMS-handling. This field shall be present only if default call handling has been applied. Parameter is defined in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription information.

**Free Format Data (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR)**
This field is contained in the CAP operation (defined in 3GPP TS 29.078, providing GPRS charging information (FCI)) sent by the gsmSCF. The data can be sent in one FCI message or several FCI messages with append indicator. This data is transferred transparently in the CAMEL session of the relevant call records.

If the FCI is received more then once during one CAMEL call, the append indicator defines whether the FCI information is appended to previous FCI and stored in the relevant record or the information of the last FCI received is stored in the relevant record (the previous FCI information shall be overwritten).

In the event of partial output, the currently valid "Free format data" is stored in the partial record.

**FFD Append Indicator (S-CDR, M-CDR)**
This field contains an indicator whether CAMEL free format data is to be appended to free format data stored in previous partial CDR. This field is needed in CDR post processing to sort out valid free format data for that call leg from sequence of partial records. Creation of partial records is independent of received FCIs and thus valid free format data may be divided to different partial records.

If field is missing then free format data in this CDR replaces all received free format data in previous CDRs. Append indicator is not needed in the first partial record. In following partial records indicator shall be true value if all FCIs received during that partial record have append indicator.

| Container 1 | Container 2 | Container 3 |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| QoS Requested = QoS1 | | |
| QoS Negotiated = QoS1 | QoS Negotiated = QoS2 | |
| Data Volume Uplink = 1 | Data Volume Uplink = 5 | Data Volume Uplink = 3 |
| Data Volume Downlink = 2 | Data Volume Downlink = 6 | Data Volume Downlink = 4 |
| Change Condition = QoS change | Change Condition = Tariff change | Change Condition = Record closed |
| Time Stamp = TIME1 | Time Stamp = TIME2 | Time Stamp = TIME3 |

First container includes initial QoS values and corresponding volume counts. Second container includes new QoS values and corresponding volume counts before tariff time change. Last container includes volume counts after the tariff time change. The total volume counts can be itemized as shown in Table 19 (tariff1 is used before and tariff2 after the tariff time change):

**Table 19: QoS Value and Total Volume Count**

| Description | Value | Container |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| QoS1+Tariff1 | uplink = 1, downlink = 2 | 1 |
| QoS2+Tariff1 | uplink = 5, downlink = 6 | 2 |
| QoS2+Tariff2 | uplink = 3, downlink = 4 | 3 |
| QoS1 | uplink = 1, downlink = 2 | 1 |
| QoS2 | uplink = 8, downlink = 10 | 2+3 |
| Tariff1 | uplink = 6, downlink = 8 | 1+2 |
| Tariff2 | uplink = 3, downlink = 4 | 3 |

The volume of data counted in the GGSN shall be the volume transited on GTP layer. Therefore the data counted already includes the IP PDP bearer protocols, i.e. IP TCP or UDP.

The data volume counted in the SGSN is the data volume on SNDCP PDUs layer. Therefore, the data counted already includes the headers of any PDP bearer protocols.

The amount of data counted in the 3G-GGSN shall be the volume transited on GTP-U layer. Therefore, the data counted already includes the headers of any PDP bearer protocols.

The amount of data counted in the 3G-SGSN shall be the data volume transmitted on GTP-U PDUs layer. Therefore, the data counted already includes the headers of any PDP bearer protocols.

In GSM, in order to avoid that downstream packets transmitted from the old SGSN to the new SGSN at inter SGSN RA update, induce the increase of the PDP CDR downstream volume counters in both SGSN, the following rules must be followed:
- For PDP contexts using LLC in unacknowledged mode: an SGSN shall update the PDP CDR when the packet has been sent by the SGSN towards the MS.
- For PDP contexts using LLC in acknowledged mode, a 2G-SGSN shall only update the PDP CDR at the reception of the acknowledgement by the MS of the correct reception of a downstream packet. In other worlds, for inter SGSN RA update, the new SGSN shall update the PDP CDR record when a downstream packet sent by the old SGSN is received by the MS and acknowledged by the MS towards the new SGSN through the RA update complete message. In UMTS, the not transferred downlink data can be accounted for in the S-CDR with "RNC Unsent Downlink Volume" field, which is the data that the RNC has discarded or forwarded during handover.

In UMTS network, the not transferred downlink data can be accounted for in the S-CDR with "RNC Unsent Downlink Volume" field, which is the data that the RNC has discarded or forwarded during handover.

Data volumes (accounted by RLC or LLC) retransmitted due to poor radio link conditions shall not be counted.
